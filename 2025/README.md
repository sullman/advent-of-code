## Advent of Code 2025

Getting a late start on a short year, so I'm going to be lazy and use
vanilla JS. No attempt will be made for clean code.

### Running

My personal workflow is to generally write the sample input to a file called
`demo` and the real input to `input`. The program reads from stdin, so I run
things like `node dayXX.js <demo` and `node dayXX.js <input`.
