## Advent of Code 2024

After using Go for a couple of years, I'm going to be lazy and just use
vanilla JS. No attempt will be made for clean code.

### Running

My personal workflow is to generally write the sample input to a file called
`demo` and the real input to `input`. The program reads from stdin, so I run
things like `node dayXX.js <demo` and `node dayXX.js <input`.
